# tech-skills

I am trying to list all my personal technical skills about web development in this repo. In the `./skills` directory, I built a simple app with github developer REST api. when input a name like **kawhi66**, all of his repos will be listed bellow.

I am still working on it.

## Usage

```javaScript
git clone git@github.com:kawhi66/tech-skills.git
```

```javaScript
cd tech-skills
yarn --registry=http://registry.npm.taobao.org
```

```javaScript
yarn dev:jquery
yarn dev --type=plain-vue
yarn dev --type=single-file-vue
```
